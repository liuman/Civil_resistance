This means, if an individual is red, then we look at the proportion of neighbours that are blue to calculate the switch rate. Similarly for blue individuals. Note, even if a node is blue and all its neighbours are red (or vice-versa) there is still a possibility of the individual to remain blue (This should reflect the fact that changing opinions is difficult). We do however want that if a blue individual is connected to only blue neighbours, the probability of becomming radicalized is 0. We shall assume first that the infection rate of red (radical ideas) is higher than blue, so that it makes sense to talk about an idea to be successful, otherwise it is obvious that blue would win if the starting percentage of red is around 3% as reffered in the paper.\n",
